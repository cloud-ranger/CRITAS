# Welcome to CRITAS from CloudRanger
## CloudRanger Instance Type Availablitity Service (CRITAS)

We are delighted to make available as a completely free service a constantly update list of all available instances in AWS across all regions.

Its always a challenge when you are builing in interface that allows users to create instances, but without making a failing call how can you be assured that the instance type is available to use in that region. This problem is the reason we developed Critas. Here we constantly maintain a list of all available AWS instance types per region. Its freely availble as a JSON file on s3.

Hope you find it useful
